3. Needs to Update the value kWh for kwh because only the letter in the middle is in uppercase (field #electricitySelectInput from Home Energy page)

4. Page https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/ ::::: 
   By automation the field #ppl-in-household-input is not allowing many INPUT number size such as 999999999999999999999999999999999. But in the web is allowing.
   Needs to be investigated and Needs to define the field size (Min and Max)

   Expected <header> to have text [-] Your Current Emissions from Transportation, but the text was **\n [-] Your Current Emissions from Transportation\n \n **
